## This script is used to count the number of entries in each chromosome. In my case, I use it to count the number of tandem repeats present in each chromosome.
## Please, note that chromosomes are named as chr in the first column.
--------------------

## To count chromosomes 1 to 22.
for i in {1..22}
do
cat [file] | awk '{ if($1 == "chr"'$i') { print $1"\t"$2 }}' | wc -l
done

## To count chromosomes X and Y
for x in X Y
do
cat [file] | grep "chr"$x | wc -l
done
